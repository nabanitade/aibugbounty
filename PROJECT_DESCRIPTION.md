## üåü Inspiration

Our inspiration came from a critical gap in the AI ecosystem: **the urgent need for comprehensive bias detection and mitigation tools** that can identify real-world discrimination in machine learning systems. 

### The Problem We Saw
- **Systematic Bias**: AI systems were making discriminatory decisions affecting vulnerable populations
- **Lack of Tools**: No comprehensive platform existed to detect, analyze, and mitigate bias across multiple protected attributes
- **Legal Risk**: Organizations faced significant compliance violations without proper bias auditing capabilities
- **Human Impact**: Real people were being denied opportunities due to algorithmic discrimination

### Our Vision
We envisioned a **complete end-to-end solution** that would:
- Detect bias across all protected attributes (gender, race, disability, citizenship)
- Provide intersectional analysis to identify compound discrimination
- Implement proven mitigation strategies with measurable results
- Generate compliance-ready reports for legal and regulatory requirements
- Create an accessible platform for organizations to ensure fair AI deployment

The **13.31 percentage point gap** we discovered between White men and Black women in loan approvals was the catalyst that drove us to build something that could prevent such discrimination in the future.
