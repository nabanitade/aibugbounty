# 🚀 AI Bias Bounty Platform

**Live Platform**: https://preview--bias-buster-ai-app.lovable.app/

This is the **AI Bias Bounty Platform**, a comprehensive tool designed to detect, analyze, and mitigate bias in machine learning models. Here's what it does:

## Core Purpose
The platform helps identify and reduce unfair bias in ML models across different demographic groups (gender, age, race, etc.) while maintaining model performance.

## Key Features

**1. Data Management**
- Upload training and test datasets (supports CSV format)
- Handles large datasets (14K+ training rows, 30K+ test rows shown)

**2. Model Training & Comparison**
- Trains multiple ML algorithms simultaneously (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Transformer)
- Automatically identifies the best-performing model
- Provides performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall)

**3. Bias Detection & Analysis**
- Analyzes bias across demographic groups (gender, age, geographic region, etc.)
- Shows disparate impact through metrics like False Positive/Negative rates
- Identifies which groups are being unfairly treated by the model

**4. Bias Mitigation**
- Offers multiple fairness techniques (like data reweighting)
- Allows adjustable mitigation strength (conservative to aggressive)
- Shows before/after comparison of bias reduction
- Maintains performance while improving fairness

**5. Model Interpretability**
- SHAP analysis showing feature importance
- LIME explanations for individual predictions
- Fairlearn metrics for comprehensive bias assessment

**6. Results & Export**
- Generates submission files for competitions/deployment
- Creates detailed bias audit reports
- Provides comprehensive documentation of bias findings and mitigation strategies

This type of tool is particularly valuable for organizations that need to ensure their AI systems are fair and compliant with regulations around algorithmic fairness, especially in sensitive domains like lending, hiring, or healthcare.

## 📊 Methodology Overview

### 1. Data Analysis
- **Training Dataset**: 10,000 loan applications
- **Protected Attributes**: Gender, Race, Disability, Citizenship
- **Target Variable**: Loan_Approved (Approved/Denied)
- **Statistical Tests**: χ² tests, two-sample z-tests, effect size analysis

### 2. Bias Detection Framework
- **Individual Fairness**: Approval rate disparities by single attributes
- **Intersectional Analysis**: Race × Gender combinations  
- **Statistical Validation**: Hypothesis testing with p-values
- **Effect Size Measurement**: Cohen's d for practical significance

### 3. Model Development
- **Feature Selection**: Excluded protected attributes for fairness
- **Algorithm Choice**: Random Forest (interpretable, handles non-linearity)
- **Validation**: Train/validation split with stratification
- **Interpretability**: SHAP values for feature importance

### 4. Bias Mitigation
- **Preprocessing**: Sample reweighting, protected attribute removal
- **In-processing**: Fairness constraints, adversarial debiasing
- **Post-processing**: Threshold optimization, equalized odds
- **Evaluation**: Demographic parity, statistical parity difference

- **Intersectional Bias**: z = 8.92, p < 0.001
- **All findings**: Highly statistically significant

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm
```python
# Simplified model pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# 1. Feature selection (fairness-aware)
features = ['Income', 'Credit_Score', 'Loan_Amount', 'Age']
X = data[features]
y = (data['Loan_Approved'] == 'Approved').astype(int)

# 2. Train with class balancing
model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    class_weight='balanced',
    random_state=42
)
model.fit(X, y)

# 3. Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Bias Detection
```python
# Intersectional analysis example
intersectional_bias = data.groupby(['Race', 'Gender'])['Loan_Approved'].apply(
    lambda x: (x == 'Approved').mean() * 100
)

# Calculate bias gap
white_men_rate = intersectional_bias.loc[('White', 'Male')]
black_women_rate = intersectional_bias.loc[('Black', 'Female')]
bias_gap = white_men_rate - black_women_rate
```

### SHAP Interpretability
```python
import shap

# Generate explanations
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_sample)

# Feature importance ranking
feature_importance = dict(zip(features, np.abs(shap_values).mean(axis=0)))
```
