| **Hispanic Women** | 906 | **36.98%** | 8th |
| **Black Women** | 620 | **35.97%** | 9th |

### 🚨 CRITICAL DISPARITY 🚨
- **White Men**: 49.28% approval rate
- **Black Women**: 35.97% approval rate  
- **Gap**: **13.31 percentage points**

This represents the most severe form of bias in the dataset, where Black women face **compounded discrimination** based on both race and gender.

## Model Performance & Feature Analysis

### Baseline Model Results
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest (100 trees, max_depth=10)
- **Training Accuracy**: 76.8%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 74.2%
- **Features Used**: Income, Credit_Score, Loan_Amount, Age

### Feature Importance Analysis

| Feature | Importance Score | Impact on Approval |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Credit_Score** | 0.4521 | Primary driver (+) |
| **Income** | 0.2847 | Strong positive (+) |
| **Loan_Amount** | 0.1892 | Negative impact (-) |
| **Age** | 0.0740 | Minor positive (+) |

### SHAP Interpretability Results

**Key Insights from SHAP Analysis:**
1. **Credit Score**: Each 100-point increase adds ~15% approval probability
2. **Income**: Higher income strongly correlates with approval
3. **Loan Amount**: Larger loans decrease approval probability
4. **Age**: Older applicants have slight advantage

**Proxy Variable Detection**: While protected attributes were excluded from the model, potential proxy variables may still exist through geographic (Zip_Code_Group) and socioeconomic factors.
